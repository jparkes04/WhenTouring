## About

I built this Next.JS app in a little over a week as a hobby project. It uses the MusicBrainz and SetlistFM APIs to collect data on artist's concert histories, which you can then explore in an interactive map powered by MapLibre and MapTiler.

You can view predictions for when a given artist will likely next perform near a location based on this data. The predictions are generated by Gemini and only take into account previous events.

I also use MongoDB to store API responses for 3 days in order to limit usage of the SetlistFM API.

## Environment variables

You need to configure the following environment variables to run the application.
